# 2. Write a Python program to get a string from a given string where all occurrences of its first char have been changed to '$', except the first char itself. //(4)
# Sample String : 'restart'
# Expected Result : 'resta$t'

# str = input("Type the restart \n")
# char = str[0] # storing first char of string for later use
# str = str.replace(char, '$') # replacing all occurrance with $ sign   $esta$t
# str = char + str[1:] # changing first char back to r


# print(str) # nprinting the output

# thislist = (("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
# print(type(thislist)) # List Casting
# # 3. Write a Python program to remove the nth index character from a nonempty string. //(9)

# string = input("write your string here \n") # user input Learning
# nthIndex = int(input("Enter the index of char what you want to remove from string\n")) 
# first_half = string[:nthIndex]
# second_half = string[nthIndex+1 :]

# result = first_half + second_half
# print(result)
